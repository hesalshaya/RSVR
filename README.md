Regulatory Scientific Verification Tool

This website enables users to quickly verify regulatory information for a specific product or active ingredient. By entering a product name and an email address, users can retrieve a detailed report outlining the product's presence in official databases, available scientific sources, and any relevant regulatory classificationsâ€”such as inclusion in restricted substance lists. The tool serves as a preliminary reference to streamline and support the regulatory verification process.
